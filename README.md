# We-Donate

## Inspiration 💡💡💡

We-donate is an android application that provides facilities to donate the stuff you want just with one click, directly to the needy. This saves the time and money of the donor. Using this application the donor can also make sure that the stuff he donated has reached the needy not.

## What it does ♾️🪄👁️‍🗨️

We-Donate focuses on digitization in a donation. We are targeting Android devices as most people are using Android-based smartphones at this time. Native Android applications are mostly written in
Java. We will use Java and XML to develop the application.

## How we built it 🧠🧠👀👀🙆‍♂️

Native Android applications are mostly written in Java. We will use Java and XML to develop the application. These designs will be stored as separate resources and will be a part of the Android package. Most of the implementation will be done using the core Android SDK, along with some additional open-source libraries for licensing. We will use the latest Android SDK available (currently API 28) for development, as it provides new features and more secure applications. Java will be used to design the logic structure of the whole Android application. We have used google cloud APIs for language translation purposes so everyone from the different regions can use our app without facing any problems.

## Challenges we ran into 🏃🏃🏃🧑‍🎓🧏‍♂️

We initially wanted to work on a solution that tries to gamify the pull request. However, XRP lacks some basic smart contract functionality to make the game realistic. Escrow is best suited for post-payment and not storing the state.

Also, we weren't able to make the GitHub Action integrate seamlessly. The limitation is due to the GitHub Action API creating a custom label that is used in the GitHub issue. The only fallback here is that we require the user to manually create the following 3 labels (XRPDonation: New, XRPDonation: Funding, XRPDonation: Done) which we also mention in the README.

Learning XRP and GitHub Actions. We are aware of the existing technology and functionality, however, we had never spent the time to deep dive into the development part of it. Spent a good amount of time going through the documentation and understanding how to navigate the docs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎖️🎖️🎖️

We-Donate has been approved to build, design, and implement an application for saving people time and money. This application can be used by people from normal users to a professional businessperson who is willing to help the needy but has no time.

## Features  ☀️🌟🧏‍♂️
• Can donate anything, from anywhere, at any time.
• Saves Time and money
• Make sure your donations are in the right hands
• Authentication Login (via. Google Account).
• Location of the donor will be automatically sent to the member
• Using GPS as soon as the donor generates the request

## What we learned 🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️

By using Requirement gathering Techniques such as Questionnaires, Brainstorming sessions, interviews, and Initial Requirements are gathered and analyzed whether they are feasible for development and determined whether the gathered requirements are unclear, incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory, and then resolving these issues. We also learned how to work remotely. We learned how to use new tools for remote work, like VS Code's Live Share features, ngrok for localhost port forwarding, GitHub for collaboration, and how to integrate APIs with the software. Learned to make production-ready cross-platform apps ready to be deployed in real-time.

## What's next for We Donate 🙇‍♂️💡💡

As we know that most people would like to give as much as they do, and we wanted to do something to try to close that gap. For those people in the future, the trusts will prepare some interesting things as a gift to donors. In the future, we can also provide different types of modes like dark mode, reading mode, etc. For the UI part. In the future, if one Trust needs something to donate but lacks things then another Trust can hand over things to that trust which they required. And Trust can interact directly with another trust via Application. We also want to integrate a feature that lets us sort by type of health care provider, so that it is easier for patients to search for solutions such as dialysis facilities or lab test providers. These features would be provided to subscribed users, and are currently in development.
